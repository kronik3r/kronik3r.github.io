            Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you <br/>
            Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here, <br/>
            And you must treat it as a powerful stranger, <br/>
            Must ask permission to know it and be known. <br/>
            The forest breathes. Listen. It answers, <br/>
            I have made this place around you. <br/>
            If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here. <br/>
            No two trees are the same to Raven. <br/>
            No two branches are the same to Wren. <br/>
            If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you, <br/>
            You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows <br/>
            Where you are. You must let it find you. <br/>
          </p>
